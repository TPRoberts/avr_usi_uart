# avr_usi_uart
A USI software UART for the ATtiny 25/45/85 

Revised and edited to compile with avr-gcc for the ATtiny45 from https://bitbucket.org/tinusaur/usiuartx
The original wass based on reference to AVR307 Half Duplex UART Using the USI Module on tinyAVR and megaAVR devices.
This version is configured for 2400 baud at a system clock of 1mhz.
The code should be easily adapted to any avr device with USI.
